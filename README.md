## Introduction

Dive into the world of regularization with my tutorial, featuring Ridge regression (L2 penalty) and LASSO regression (L1 penalty). Explore Mean Squared Error (MSE) contours, visualize the impact of collinearity, and uncover how L1 and L2 penalties shape model complexity. Prepare to gain deeper insights into regularization methods through concise explanations and 3D visualizations. Enhance your understanding and application of these techniques with my comprehensive guide.


## Environment Setup

**Prerequisites**: Ensure Python 3.6 or newer is installed on your system.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Install `virtualenv` if you prefer it over the built-in `venv` (optional):
        ```bash
        pip install virtualenv
        ```
    - Create the environment:
        - With `venv` (Python 3.3+):
            ```bash
            python -m venv env
            ```
        - Or, with `virtualenv`:
            ```bash
            virtualenv env
            ```
    - Activate the environment:
        - Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
        - Unix/MacOS: `source env/bin/activate`
    - To deactivate: `deactivate`

2. **Dependencies**:
    Ensure all dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
